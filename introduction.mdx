description: A blazing-fast command-line fuzzy finder that helps you navigate files, command history, processes, and more with ease.

<Note>
  fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder that works as an interactive filter for any kind of list.
</Note>

fzf implements a "fuzzy" matching algorithm, allowing you to quickly type patterns with omitted characters and still get the results you want. Whether you're searching through files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, or git commits, fzf makes navigation effortless.

## Key features

### Interactive filtering

fzf reads from STDIN and writes selected items to STDOUT, making it a perfect filter for any command-line workflow:

```bash
# Find and open a file
find * -type f | fzf > selected

# Or use fzf directly to traverse the file system
vim $(fzf)
```

### Powerful search syntax

Use advanced search patterns to find exactly what you need:

| Pattern | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sbtrkt` | Fuzzy match |
| `'wild` | Exact match (quoted) |
| `^music` | Prefix match |
| `.mp3$` | Suffix match |
| `!fire` | Inverse match |

```bash
# Find MP3 files that start with "music" but don't contain "fire"
fzf --query "^music .mp3$ !fire"
```

### Multiple display modes

<CodeGroup>

```bash Fullscreen mode (default)
fzf
```

```bash Height mode
# Start below cursor with 40% height
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border
```

```bash Tmux popup mode
# Open in tmux popup if available
fzf --tmux center,80%
```

</CodeGroup>

### Shell integration

Once installed, fzf provides powerful key bindings:

- **CTRL-T** - Paste selected files and directories onto the command-line
- **CTRL-R** - Paste selected command from history
- **ALT-C** - cd into the selected directory

### Preview window

Preview file contents, git diffs, or any output while navigating:

```bash
# Preview files with syntax highlighting
fzf --preview 'bat --color=always {}'

# Interactive ripgrep with preview
rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always "" | \
  fzf --ansi --preview 'bat --color=always {1} --highlight-line {2}'
```
