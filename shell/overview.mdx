description: Overview of fzf's shell integration features including key bindings and fuzzy completion
---

fzf provides powerful shell integration features that enhance your command-line experience with interactive fuzzy finding capabilities. These integrations are available for Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells.

## What is Shell Integration?

Shell integration adds two main features to your shell:

1. **Key Bindings** - Interactive shortcuts for common operations
2. **Fuzzy Completion** - Tab completion with fuzzy matching

These features seamlessly integrate fzf into your daily command-line workflow, making file navigation, command history search, and directory traversal faster and more intuitive.

## Key Bindings

fzf provides three essential key bindings that work across all supported shells:

  </Card>
  <Card title="CTRL-R" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Search and paste commands from shell history
  </Card>
  <Card title="ALT-C" icon="folder">
    Navigate to a selected directory
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Fuzzy Completion

Fuzzy completion is triggered by typing `**` followed by the Tab key. This works for:

- File and directory paths
- Process IDs (for `kill` command)
- Host names (for `ssh` command)
- Environment variables and aliases

```bash
# Examples
vim **<TAB>          # Select files to edit
cd **<TAB>           # Select directory to change to
kill -9 **<TAB>      # Select process to kill
ssh **<TAB>          # Select host to connect to
```

## Quick Setup

Add one line to your shell configuration file:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(fzf --bash)"
```

```zsh Zsh
# Add to ~/.zshrc
source <(fzf --zsh)
```

```fish Fish
# Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
fzf --fish | source
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The `--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options require fzf 0.48.0 or later. For older versions, you'll need to source the script files manually from the `/shell` directory.
</Note>

## Environment Variables

Shell integration behavior can be customized using environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FZF_TMUX_HEIGHT` | Height for tmux split (default: 40%) |
| `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` | Command to generate file list for CTRL-T |
| `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS` | Additional fzf options for CTRL-T |
| `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS` | Additional fzf options for CTRL-R |
| `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` | Command to generate directory list for ALT-C |
| `FZF_ALT_C_OPTS` | Additional fzf options for ALT-C |
| `FZF_COMPLETION_TRIGGER` | Trigger sequence for completion (default: `**`) |
| `FZF_COMPLETION_OPTS` | Additional fzf options for completion |

## Display Modes

You can configure how fzf displays in your shell using `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` or the specific `*_OPTS` variables:

```bash
# Open in tmux popup if on tmux, otherwise use --height mode
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --tmux bottom,40% --layout reverse --border top'

# Customize CTRL-T with preview
export FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS="
  --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}'
  --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(down|hidden|)'"

# Customize CTRL-R with header
export FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS="
  --bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo -n {2..} | pbcopy)+abort'
  --header 'Press CTRL-Y to copy command into clipboard'"

# Customize ALT-C with tree preview
export FZF_ALT_C_OPTS="
  --preview 'tree -C {}'"
```

## Disabling Bindings

You can disable specific key bindings by setting the corresponding `*_COMMAND` variable to an empty string when sourcing the script:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bash
# Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C
FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval "$(fzf --bash)"
```

```zsh Zsh
# Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C
FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source <(fzf --zsh)
```

```fish Fish
# Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C
fzf --fish | FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Setting these variables **after** sourcing the script will have no effect. They must be set before or during sourcing.
</Warning>
