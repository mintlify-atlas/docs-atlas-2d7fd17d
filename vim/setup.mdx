title: Installing fzf in Vim/Neovim
description: Set up fzf as a Vim or Neovim plugin for fuzzy finding inside your editor
---

fzf can be integrated into Vim and Neovim as a plugin, enabling fuzzy finding capabilities directly within your editor.

## Installation Methods

<Steps>

### Choose Your Installation Method

There are several ways to install fzf in Vim/Neovim depending on your setup.

### Using vim-plug (Recommended)

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add the following to your Vim configuration file:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Using Local Installation
" If installed using Homebrew
Plug '/usr/local/opt/fzf'

" If installed using Homebrew on Apple Silicon
Plug '/opt/homebrew/opt/fzf'

" If you have cloned fzf on ~/.fzf directory
Plug '~/.fzf'
```

```vim Using GitHub (Recommended)
" Get the latest Vim plugin file from GitHub
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
```

```vim With fzf.vim Commands
" Install both fzf and fzf.vim for additional commands
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The `fzf#install()` function ensures you have the latest fzf binary. If fzf is not found on `$PATH`, it will prompt to download it for you.
</Note>

### Manual Installation

If you don't use a plugin manager, add fzf to your `&runtimepath` manually:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Homebrew Intel Mac
" Add this to your .vimrc or init.vim
set rtp+=/usr/local/opt/fzf
```

```vim Homebrew Apple Silicon
set rtp+=/opt/homebrew/opt/fzf
```

```vim Git Clone
" If you cloned fzf to ~/.fzf
set rtp+=~/.fzf
```

</CodeGroup>

</Steps>

## Additional Plugin: fzf.vim

While the basic fzf plugin provides core functionality, you may want to install [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) as a separate plugin for additional useful commands:

```vim
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

The `fzf.vim` plugin provides commands like:

- `:Files` - Search files
- `:Buffers` - Search open buffers
- `:Rg` - Search with ripgrep
- `:Lines` - Search lines in loaded buffers
- And many more

<Tip>
The `fzf.vim` project is maintained separately and offers a rich set of pre-built commands for common tasks.

## Neovim: Consider fzf-lua

If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua):

```lua
-- Using lazy.nvim
{
  'ibhagwan/fzf-lua',
  dependencies = { 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' },
  config = function()
    require('fzf-lua').setup({})
  end
}
```

<Note>
fzf-lua is a pure Lua implementation designed specifically for Neovim, offering better performance and deeper integration with Neovim's Lua API.
</Note>

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify fzf is working by running:

```vim
:FZF
```

This should open the fzf file finder in your current directory.
